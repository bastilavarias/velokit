# 🚀 Velokit – The Last Online System Boilerplate You'll Ever Need

**Velokit** is a modular, full-stack boilerplate built for developers who are tired of bloated templates that assume too much.

Whether you're building a SaaS, an e-commerce site, a gym tracker, or something wild no one's thought of yet — Velokit gives you the perfect starting point, and nothing more.

## 🧠 What is Velokit?

Velokit is a **starter kit for serious builders**.

- 🏗️ Built with **Go** on the backend — fast, typed, rock solid.
- ⚡ Powered by **SvelteKit** on the frontend — simple, reactive, beautiful.
- 🧩 Designed around **modules** — add only the features *you* need.
- 🤘 Zero lock-in. Infinite flexibility. Your stack, your rules.

This isn’t some cookie-cutter SaaS kit.

This is your **digital playground** — scalable, extendable, and fast as hell.

## 🧩 You Want Features? You Pick Them.

Some projects need `memberships`. Others need `orders`, `products`, or `teams`.

Velokit doesn’t shove features down your throat.

**Start from a clean slate**, and drop in only what your app needs:
- Need billing? Add it.
- Need a CRM? Drop in `contacts`, `notes`, `pipelines`.
- Just want an auth + dashboard starter? You got it.

You're not stuck building around someone else's assumptions.

## 🎯 Built For Devs Who...

- 🛠️ Build MVPs fast
- 🧠 Think in components and features
- 🪚 Want full control without full effort
- 🚀 Need something they can actually ship from

If you're the type of dev who builds their own tools, but appreciates a damn good head start — Velokit is for you.

## 🔥 Use Cases

- 🛒 Online Store? → Add `products`, `orders`, done.
- 🏋️ Gym App? → Add `members`, `classes`, `subscriptions`.
- 💼 CRM? → Add `contacts`, `deals`, `notes`.
- 🧱 Custom client platform? Start thin and stack what’s needed.

Velokit is the boilerplate that bends to your ideas — not the other way around.

## 🧬 A New Way to Start Projects

Most boilerplates are either too simple to scale, or so bloated they’re impossible to maintain.

**Velokit is the sweet spot.**

- Minimal by default
- Modular by design
- Maintainable in the long run

This isn’t a template. This is a **system architecture you’ll reuse forever**.

## 💭 The Philosophy

> 🧠 "Start simple. Add only what matters. Own your code."

Velokit respects your decisions. It gives you just enough to move fast, but stays out of your way when you go deep.

There’s no magic. Just clean design.

---

## 💸 It's Free. For Real.

This isn't some fake “starter” that hides real features behind a paywall.

Velokit is free and open for everyone — because great software should be **accessible**.

---

## 🫱 Ready When You Are

You don't need permission to build great software.

Velokit gives you the structure, freedom, and speed to do it your way.
