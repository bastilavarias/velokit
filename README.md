## 🧩 Modules Are Just the Icing

Some apps need `members`, some need `orders`. That’s where Velokit modules come in.

Plug-and-play features you add *only if you want them*:

- `store`: products, orders, discounts  
- `gym`: memberships, classes  
- `crm`: contacts, notes, pipelines  
- `teams`: org-level collaboration  
- and more...

Your base stays lean. Your app stays focused.
